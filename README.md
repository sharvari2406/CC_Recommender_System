# Recommender System
## Machine Learning Development Project

### Project Deliverables:
1. Creation of a recommendation system.
2. Classification of each event into one or more domains.
3. Matching each event from the database with all interested employees.
4. Outputting the list of matching employees per event.
5. Gathering employees' domain preferences.
6. Implementation of a system with accurate results.

### Project Scope:
This project aims to enhance employee/intern satisfaction and attract more individuals to participate in events by developing a robust recommender system. The key objectives include:

1. Improving Satisfaction: The project aims to improve the satisfaction level of employees and interns by recommending events aligned with their interests.
2. Event Domain Classification: The system will classify each event into one or more domains to facilitate accurate recommendations.
3. Employee Domain Database: A comprehensive database of employee domain interests will be created to personalize recommendations.
4. Matching Events with Interested Employees: The system will match each event with interested employees based on their preferences and display the list of matches according to the domain.
5. Machine Learning Model Training: Utilizing appropriate technologies such as Python 3.6 and TensorFlow, the machine learning model will be trained to ensure compatibility and efficiency.

This project will leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to develop a robust recommender system that enhances employee engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized event recommendations tailored to their interests.
